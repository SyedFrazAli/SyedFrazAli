**MSc Software Engineering Student | Flutter & Full-Stack Dev | Building User-Centric Apps from Design to Deployment | Open to Graduate Software Roles**

MSc Software Engineering student at the University of Greater Manchester with a "jack of all trades" approach to building software. I work across the full stack from UI design and Flutter mobile apps to web development and applied machine learning turning ideas into products people actually use.

Over the past three years, I've built cross-platform mobile applications, architected secure web systems for research data, and applied ML techniques to real-world problems. I'm comfortable jumping between Figma mockups, Flutter code, REST APIs, and Python notebooks, which lets me see projects from multiple angles and deliver end-to-end solutions.

## What I Bring

• **Mobile development:** Flutter apps for iOS and Android, including the Shudan B2B Wholesale App with seamless cross-platform UI  
• **Web engineering:** Responsive platforms with secure data management (CRPA Pvt Ltd), optimized for performance and accessibility  
• **Applied AI:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn for data extraction, model building, and evaluation  
• **Full-stack mindset:** Dart, JavaScript, Java, Python, C++ | Flutter, Angular, Spring Boot | Git, Linux, AWS, Azure

Currently pursuing my MSc (Jan 2025–Jul 2026) and actively seeking graduate software engineering, Flutter developer, or full-stack roles in the UK where I can contribute across design, development, and deployment.

## Skills

• **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart  
• **Machine Learning & Data Science:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit, Anaconda  
• **Web & Mobile Development:** Angular, Flutter, Spring Boot, REST APIs  
• **Cloud & Tools:** AWS, Azure, Git, Linux, Firebase  
• **UI/UX:** Figma, User Interface Design  
• **Soft Skills:** Teamwork, Project Management, Communication, Leadership, Organization, Problem-solving, Attention to Detail
